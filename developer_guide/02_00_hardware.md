### Overview

Each camera can be considered to be a distributed system of processors and peripherals, able to communicate via interrupts, shared memory, or message passing.  Not all devices are connected to all others.  Not all communication options are applicable to all devices; you must use what works.

Our knowledge of what devices exist is incomplete.  Our knowledge of what devices can do is limited.  This section will try not to mislead you, but it is bound to contain incomplete information, and likely to contain incorrect information.

#### Digic

Digic (officially: DiG!C) is the main ASIC for Canon cameras.  This contains one or more ARM cores, which run the primary OS, and many peripherals, including DSPs, high precision timers, etc.

Digic exists in many generations, with ML having good support for Digic 4 and 5.  There is no generation 9, this was skipped in preference for the term Digic X.  ML support for generations 6 and 7 has had some success, gens 8 and X have limited support with undiagnosed bugs making stable builds not yet possible.

This document may use D4 to indicate Digic 4, or D678 to indicate any generation from 6 to 8, inclusive - or other similar constructions.

#### "Supervisor" CPU (MPU)

An important CPU is termed the MPU. It is present in most if not all of DSLRs, and DSLR-based mirrorless models.  In the past it's (lack of) presence combined with "firmware flavour" was the distinction between DSLR-style models (covered by Magic Lantern) and point-and-shots, covered by CHDK project.

MPU runs DryOS, like the Main CPU. Its architecture changed at least 3 times over the years. We don't run any custom code there.

An approximate split of duties is that the ICU handles UI and CPU intensive tasks, while the MPU handles low-level tasks such as battery management, switch and button handling.  In some senses, the MPU is the primary CPU: it is responsible for detecting power on events and bringing the ICU up.  The MPU is also responsible for turning the cam off should e.g., the battery door be opened. 

MPU-less models use a simplified approach, where a small controller IC (in SX70/SX740 identified to be Cortex M0) is responsible only of low level power handling.  In those cameras "traditional MPU" tasks are handled directly on Main CPU.

Since Digic 8 Canon merged both software stacks into one, based on DSLR variant - but two distinct hardware designs remain.  For this reason we still call those "PowerShots", from their hardware legacy.  Examples of this category are EOS M50, PowerShot SX740 and SX70.

#### Main CPU (ICU)

The main CPU, from an ML perspective, is termed the ICU.  Our code runs here.  A lot of DryOS code runs here, also.

There are three main families of ARM used across Digic gens that we care about.  D45 uses ARMv5TE.  D6 uses ARMv7-R.  This has a Memory Protection Unit (MPU!  But not the same MPU as above).  D78X use ARMv7-A and have a full MMU.

 - D45 are single core parts.
 - D6 are less well understood.  There's a Master and Slave CPU, both ARMv7-R.  These might be on the same chip.
 - D78X parts are true dual-core, with shared RAM.  They have ARM GIC and can communicate in a standard manner via interrupts.  In addition, DryOS provides at least two RPC mechanisms.

Some cams are described by Canon as Dual Digic.  E.g. the 7D Mark II, which has two independent Digic 6 ASICs.  This probably makes it somewhat equivalent to a dual-socket, dual-core system.

Some cams have a secondary Digic, of a lower generation, used for a subset of tasks.  For example, the 1DX is D5, but uses a D4 for auto-exposure.

Lastly, and least important to ML, some Digic gens come in a normal and "+" variant.  E.g. the 5D Mark III is Digic 5+.  These plus variants don't seem to have extra capabilities, and are likely the same fundamental design, perhaps die-shrunk, and clocked higher.  From a processing power perspective this is important - Canon claims a 3x improvement between some plus and non-plus parts.  From a reverse engineering perspective the differences are minimal.

Points of note:

- All cams can run Thumb instructions
- D45 can use cache locking to "edit" instructions in code ROM
- D78X have MMU so can "edit" large regions of code ROM
- D6 doesn't have a proven way to "edit" ROM
- Dual-core ICUs run single OS instance dual core.
- In dual/triple ICU configurations, each ICU runs own separate OS instance.

#### Secondary cores and processors

There are further cores for specialised tasks.  Since these are utilised via APIs and / or message passing, their internals are poorly understood.  Most of those run separate instances of DryOS.

Tasks that are performance critical (either throughput or latency) may run on some accelerator.  E.g., JPEG compression, video compression.  These are likely ASICs, though there are signs that external FPGAs are used in some generations.  Possibly, early implementations use FPGA, which are later converted to ASICs.

Cams with integrated networking typically delegate this to another part.  On D78X this is Xtensa ISA and internally named "Lime".  The ICU can command Lime, which, presumably, directly controls some WiFi SoC.

#### Other peripherals

Not all devices are processors.  There are many MMIO devices, critical to controlling the camera.  Some are digital, e.g. the DMA controller.  Some border on analog, e.g. there's a unit named ADTG which is believed to be a timing generator, used for controlling how the sensor is read out.  Digital configuration, most likely controlling analog hardware.

MMIO addresses are used by the ICU (and potentially other processors) to configure, control, or read information from, these peripherals.
