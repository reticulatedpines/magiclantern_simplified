echo "     ./run_canon_fw.sh 60D,firmware=\"boot=1\""
echo "   - to use multiple firmware versions, place the ROMs under e.g. 5D3/113/ROM*.BIN and run:"
echo "     ./run_canon_fw.sh 5D3,firmware=\"113;boot=1\""
echo "   - to show MMIO activity (registers) and interrupts, use:"
echo "     ./run_canon_fw.sh 60D -d io,int"
echo "   - to show the executed ASM code, step by step, use:"
echo "     ./run_canon_fw.sh 60D -d exec,int -singlestep"
echo "   - to trace debug messages and various functions in the firmware, use:"
echo "     ./run_canon_fw.sh 60D -d debugmsg -s -S & $ARM_GDB -x 60D/debugmsg.gdb"
echo "   - some camera models require GDB patches to bypass tricky code sequences:"
echo "     ./run_canon_fw.sh EOSM -s -S & $ARM_GDB -x EOSM/patches.gdb"
