# Reorder the stub files and group them by categories
#
# Categories are inferred from existing stubs (these comments mark a category: /** Category **/ )
# Inconsistent category names are flagged as errors (you can choose preferred_categs names) 
# 
# This script does only these things:
# - group recognized stubs by categories (simply reordering lines, without changing them)
# - put uncategorized stubs into Misc at the end
# - declare stubs found on other cameras as ???
# - put lines that could not be parsed at the beginning
#
#  => it should have very little destructive potential
# 
# -- a1ex

# if there are same stubs in different categories, prefer these names
