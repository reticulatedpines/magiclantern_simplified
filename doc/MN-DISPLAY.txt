Options for display (most of them are for LiveView).

.. _contrast:

LV contrast
```````````

Adjusts the contrast in LiveView. It does not affect recording. This helps when focusing with very flat picture styles.

Choices: *Normal* (no effect), *High*, *Very high*, *Low*, *Very low*, *Zero*.

.. _saturation:

LV saturation
`````````````

Adjusts the saturation in LiveView. It does not affect recording. This helps you focus without being distracted by color.

Choices: *Normal* (no effect), *High*, *Very high*, *Zero (grayscale)*.

.. _night vision:
.. _display gain:

LV display gain
```````````````

{{ nightdemo.jpg?200}}

Photo mode only: this feature increases the brightness in LiveView, making it usable in very dark scenes (where Canon's LiveView would be pitch black). Combine this with FPS override for better low-light performance.

Range: 0 ... +7 EV.

For movie mode, use ML digital ISOs for a similar effect.

Color scheme
````````````

This affects the colors and brightness for on-screen information (including LiveView overlays, Canon menus and ML menus).

Choices: *Default*, *Dark*, *Bright Gray*, *Dark Gray*, *Dark Red*, *Dark Green*. 

Tip: dark themes may reduce the eye strain during night shooting.

.. _Clean LiveView display:

Clear overlays
``````````````
 
Clear bitmap overlays from LiveView display.
 
* **HalfShutter**: LiveView overlays are cleared when you hold the shutter button pressed halfway for one second. You can also use the ``*`` button or the ``DOF preview`` button.
  
  Tip: assign autofocus to ``*`` button (from Custom Functions, set ``Shutter/AE lock button`` = ``AE lock/AF``).
  
* **WhenIdle**: In this mode, all the overlays are erased from the screen (100% clean display) when the camera is idle (i.e. a few seconds after last button press).

* **Always**: In this mode, all the overlays are erased. Menus will work normally.
  
  Tip: this feature may be useful with [[External Recorders]], since it removes the focus box and other graphics from the display.

Focus box (LV)
``````````````

With this setting you can choose to show the Focus box in LiveView or hide it when not needed.

Force HDMI-VGA
``````````````

This option will force a low-resolution mode on HDMI displays (720x480), which avoids blank screen when you start/stop recording.

Screen layout settings...
`````````````````````````

Screen orientation, positioning fine tuning, adjustments for external monitors...

Screen Layout
"""""""""""""

Choose screen layout (position of ML top and bottom bars), for different cameras or for external monitors.
  
Top/bottom layouts:
  
* **Inside 3:2**: default layout for 3:2-screen cameras (550D and newer).
* **Inside 16:10**: for 16:10 HDMI monitors.
* **Inside 16:9**: for 16:9 HDMI monitors.
* **4:3 movie**: for 5D Mark II, 500D and 50D in movie mode.
  
Bottom-only layouts:

* **Under 3:2**: useful for 4:3-screen cameras (500D, 50D, 5D Mark 2) in photo mode.
* **Under 16:9**: suitable for low-resolution external monitors and for 4:3-screen cameras in movie mode.


Image position
""""""""""""""

This may make the image better visible from different angles (especially on cameras without flip-out screen).


UpsideDown mode
"""""""""""""""

{{ up_down.jpg?200}}

This mode is useful if you want to mount your camera upside-down.


Auto Mirroring
""""""""""""""

For cameras with flip-out LCD, this options prevents mirroring the display when you open it at 180 degrees.

Display: Normal/Reverse/Mirror
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

For cameras with flip-out LCD, you may select a different flipping/mirroring option.

Level Indicator (60D)
`````````````````````

Shows if the picture levels with the horizon. Can be used while recording.

Kill Canon GUI
``````````````

For 50D only: disable Canon graphics elements to avoid conflicts with ML graphics in LiveView.
 
* **Idle/Menus**: only enable Canon graphics when some transparent menu from LiveView is active.
* **Idle/Menus+Keys**: only enable Canon graphics when you press some keys or navigate the transparent menus from LiveView.
