ML Coding Style
===============

Please use the script check-before-hg-commit.sh in the scripts
directory to check your changes before commiting.

1. Whitespace

ML indents are four spaces. Tabs are never used, except in Makefiles
where they have been irreversibly coded into the syntax.

Do not leave whitespace dangling off the ends of lines.


2. Line width

Lines are 80 characters; not longer.


3. Line ending Style

Use Unix line ending style (LF).

Setup your text editor to use Unix line endings or use
dos2unix-like software.


4. Naming

Variables are lower_case_with_underscores.


5. Block structure

a1ex following the Allman indent style
(see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Allman_style).

Here is an example:

    if (i < 4)
    {
        /* here we go again... */
        auto_ettr_wait_lv_frames(15);
    }
    else
    {
        /* or... not? */
        beep();
        NotifyBox(2000, "Whoops");
        goto end;
    }

You can use the Artistic Style software (http://astyle.sourceforge.net)
to beautify your code according to the Allman style:

 astyle --style=allman <file_name.c>
