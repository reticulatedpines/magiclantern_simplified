Functions specific to movie mode.

.. _Bitrate control:
.. _bitrate:

Bit Rate
````````

Controls H.264 bitrate used for video recording.
  
Possible modes:
  
* **CBR**: constant bitrate. You specify a factor for multiplying default video bitrate, between 0.1x and 3x. CBR 1x is the firmware default setting.
* **QScale**: constant quality, variable bitrate (VBR). Available values: -16 ... +16. Lower numbers mean higher bitrates.
* **Firmware default**: completely disable bitrate control.
    
Notes:
 
* Increasing the bitrate **may cause recording to stop**. You need a fast card.
* CBR actually works by adjusting QScale on the fly; the instant value is displayed near the recording dot.
* In QScale mode, bitrate is completely out of control (don't use it!).
* In CBR mode, QScale will not go outside [-16...+16]. When QScale reaches the extreme values (-16 or +16), bitrate **will be different** than your CBR setting. Watch the bitrate indicators. This is not a bug, please do not report it.
* You can push the bitrate higher if you record without sound, then use `Audio RemoteShot`_ to sync the video with an external audio track.
* You can't change this setting during recording.
* If buffer usage gets too high, ML will pause all CPU-intensive graphics. Change the ``BuffWarnLevel`` setting to customize this.

.. _time remaining display:

Time Indicator
``````````````

When recording a movie, ML will display a small time counter in the upper right corner, 
which can be:

* **Elapsed**: duration of the current clip
* **Remain.Card**: estimated amount of recording time remaining on the card.
* **Remain.4GB**:  estimated amount of recording time until reaching 4GB (or until filling the card, whichever comes first).

Unlike Canon's timer which assumes constant bitrate, ML timer assumes variable bitrate and works even if QScale is enabled.
However, due to variations in bitrate, the estimated value will fluctuate a lot, and **this is normal**.

.. _movie logging:

Movie Logging
`````````````

If this setting is ``ON``, Magic Lantern will write out a metadata file for the each movie to ``MVI_1234.LOG`` (numbered after the movie). The log file contains lens and exposure info, as well as a timestamp every time any of the parameters is changed during recording. 
  
Log files are placed in the same folder as the movies: ``DCIM/100CANON/``, ``101CANON`` etc.
  
Tip: you can rename ``LOG`` files to ``CSV`` and import them in MS Excel.

.. _auto-restart:
.. _movie restart:

Movie Restart
`````````````

While this setting is on, movie recording will restart automatically, unless you stop it. There will be a few seconds skipped during restarting.


REC/STBY notify
```````````````

Custom notifications for recording or standby:
  
* **Red Crossout** (highly recommended if you forget to press record);
* **Message** (it shows ``STBY`` or ``REC``);
* **Beeps** (it will beep when recording starts or stops);
* **Blue LED** (obvious if your camera has it).

.. _Movie REC key:

Movie REC key
`````````````

This option enables you to start/stop movie recording by half-pressing the shutter button.

Tip: with this, you can use a wired remote to start/stop recording.

Force LiveView
``````````````

Force LiveView in Movie mode (bypass the dialog saying *Press LV button to activate movie shooting*).
  
* **Always**: force LiveView even if you use an unchipped lens, or no lens at all. Be careful, you may get dust on the sensor while changing lenses.
* **Start & CPU lenses**: it will force LiveView at startup, regardless of the lens used. After this, it will only bypass the dialog when a chipped lens is attached (i.e. it will enter LiveView as soon as you attach a chipped lens).

Shutter Lock
````````````

This option locks the shutter value in movie mode, so you don't change it by mistake (you will be able to change it only from ML menu).

.. _FPS:
.. _FPS override:
.. _FPS control:
.. _slit-scan pictures:

FPS override
````````````

This setting alters FPS for all video modes. Only undercranking works well.

FPS is changed by altering two timer values (let's call them Timer A and Timer B). Increasing any of these values results in lower FPS. Aside from FPS, changing these timers may alter shutter speed and rolling shutter.

Options:
  
* **Desired FPS**: choose a value from 0.2 fps to 65 fps. If the desired value is not possible, ML will choose the closest safe option (look at 'Actual FPS' below).
  
* **Optimize for**: 
    
  * **Low light**: use this option for recording timelapse with shutter speeds close to 1/fps (360 degrees); at high FPS values, you may be able to use other shutter speed values.
  * **Exact FPS**: tries to achieve an exact FPS value, such as 24.000 or 30.000 or 12.500. If more exact solutions are found, ML will choose the one with lowest jello effect.
  * **High FPS**: changes FPS without altering shutter speed and allows a slight overcranking (60D, 600D).
  * **LowJello, 180d**: tries to minimize the jello effect (caused by rolling shutter), while allowing you to expose at 180 degrees (0.5/fps) if possible.
  * **High Jello**: maximizes the jello effect and enables fast shutter speeds. You can use this mode for recording slit-scan frames (distorted images `like these <http://people.rit.edu/andpph/text-slit-scan.html>`_, which use the extreme jello effect in creative ways).

* **Shutter range**: displays the available shutter speed range with current settings. When you use FPS override, Canon menu will still display 1/30 ... 1/4000, but the actual shutter speed will be different; read it from ML displays. You can alter shutter speed range by changing the ratio between the two timer values (decreasing timer B will result in faster shutter speeds available).
 
* **Timer A**: displays the value of timer A and lets you fine-tune it. ML will re-adjust timer B to match your FPS choice.
  
* **Timer B**: displays the value of timer B and lets you fine-tune it. ML will not re-adjust timer A, so this option will let you fine-tune the exact FPS value.
 
* **TG Frequency**: displays the crystal oscillator frequency of the FPS circuit driver (read-only, depends on your camera).
  
* **Actual FPS**: this displays the current FPS, computed as TG_FREQ / timerA / timerB (read-only).
  
* **Sound Record**: by default, ML will disable sound recording when FPS override is enabled; otherwise, audio will go out of sync and recording will stop. Only enable sound if you know what you are doing.

Notes and tips:  

* This function will **not** change the frame rate from the video header; the video will playback at the setting from Canon menu.

* Recommended usage: set FPS to a very low value (for example, 3fps) to record a timelapse.

* To get 180-degree shutter speed at very low FPS, simply discard half of the frames in post.

* If 0.2 FPS is not enough, use `Frame Merger <http://bit.ly/frame-merger>`_ (a VirtualDub plugin).

* Exact frame rate may be "rounded" to be an exact multiple of PAL/NTSC frame rates.
      
  * PAL modes: 25p/50p. Rounded frame rates: 33.333fps, 12.5fps, 11.111fps and so on.
  * NTSC modes: 30p/60p/24p. Rounded frame rates: 29.97fps, 23.976fps, 11.988fps and so on.

* For fine-tuning and calibrating custom frame rates, use `EOSTimerGen <http://bit.ly/EOSTimerGen>`_.

* Tip: this feature **also works in photo mode**, making LiveView usable in dark environments. Combine it with `display gain`_.

HDR video
`````````

{{ vimeo>33987353?250x140|Magic Lantern HDR Video}}

This feature allows you to shoot a high dynamic range video by alternating ISO every other frame. Select the two ISO values from the submenu.

Possible postprocessing workflows:

* Interframe script: `user-friendly version <https://bitbucket.org/a1ex/magic-lantern/downloads/HDR-workflow-051.zip>`_ and `bare-bone version <https://bitbucket.org/hudson/magic-lantern/src/tip/hdr>`_;
* `GingerHDR <http://www.gingerhdr.com/>`_ (plugin for Adobe After Effects and Premiere)
* `Magic Lantern HDR Compose generator for FCP X <http://alex4d.wordpress.com/2012/01/03/ml-u-hdr-compose-fcpx-plug-in/>`_
* `HDR Glogger Web Service <http://hdr.glogger.mobi/upload_hdr.php>`_
* etc (please help me filling the list!)

#See also the `postprocessing thread on the forum <http://www.magiclantern.fm/forum/index.php?board=14.0>`_.

Note: this feature does not work on 500D/T1i.

Image Effects...
````````````````

Custom image effects found by investigating DIGIC registers:

* **Desaturate** (tip: this lets you record grayscale with any picture style);
* **Negative** image;
* **Swap U-V** (red becomes blue);
* **Cartoon look** (for this to work, set sharpness in your picture style to any nonzero value).


Movie Record (50D)
``````````````````
  
Enable movie recording on 50D (1920x1080, 30fps, without sound). To start recording, go to LiveView (P/Tv/Av/M) and press SET.
  
**WARNING:** Canon 50D was **NOT** designed to record movies. Keep in mind:
  
* This feature was not thoroughly tested by Canon and may be unstable (even if you record without ML).
* Always disable movie recording when you don't use it.
* Battery will drain quickly when recording; also, the camera may overheat.
  
Limitations:
  
* The camera will not record sound. You can use an external recorder (for example, `Zoom H1, H2 or H4n <http://amzn.to/zoom-h>`_) and sync the sound in post with a clapperboard.
* You can't play back movies in the camera.
  
#This setting remains active even if you start the camera with standard firmware (until you clear your settings).

Shutter Button (50D)
````````````````````

* **Leave unchanged**: obvious :)
* **Block during REC**: blocks the shutter and related (AF, ``*``) buttons while recording. In 50D, taking pictures while recording would result in ERR99; with this option, you can avoid taking pictures while recording by mistake. Side effect: this will disable image stabilization during recording.
* **Hold during REC (IS)**: ML will keep the shutter button pressed half-way during recording, which will enable image stabilization (IS). Side effect: you need to press the shutter button half way to turn IS off before the camera will let you stop recording.

Exposure Lock (50D)
```````````````````

Locks the exposure in movie mode. You can also use the ``*`` button (you don't have to hold it pressed).
