Print screen after 10 seconds. This option saves a BMP file for the overlays and a 422 file (silent picture) for the LiveView image. The BMP does not contain transparency data. You can combine the two files in GIMP or other image editing programs.

The card LED will blink every second, until the screenshot is taken.
