These ports were not maintained for months (in some cases, years), and now they are outdated. Sorry about that.

If you are able to bring them back to life, please feel free to do so.

For some of these ports you can borrow some code from Tragic Lantern (see http://www.magiclantern.fm/forum/index.php?topic=8900 ).

To compile any of these, you have to move the camera directory up one level first.
