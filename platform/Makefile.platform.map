# SJE FIXME 7D Master build is broken, looks like it always has been.
# Low prio to fix, this is the secondary digic.  However, 7D lists
# 7D_MASTER as a dep for the "all" target, which means "make zip" for 7D
# works, but "make" does not.  I don't know if there's a run-time
# dependency and you really need both on your cam for it to work,
# so I'm disabling both (no devs have a 7D so we can't test)
