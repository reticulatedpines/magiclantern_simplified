Test and fix take_screenshot(), there's some YUV / RGB confusion
going on and my workaround is hackish.

Verify cfn.c contents are sane

Verify if include/platform/mvr.h makes any sense

Check all the low and medium confidence items in consts.h

Fix include/platform/state-object.h constants

Decide what to do with src/fps-engio.c change for CONFIG_200D.  It's probably
safe as is, but look at CONFIG_100D, quite different.  What is 200D really like?

Work out what to do to replace _flush_i_cache() in patch.c, see CONFIG_200D
 - half fixed by using cache.c instead
