# We can get space for ML both by shrinking Canon's "user_mem" malloc heap
# by changing its end address, and by moving the sys_mem and sys_objs regions
# upwards; creating a gap in the middle.
#
# Some info is available from drysh:
#          ("meminfo -m" in drysh)    ("memmap" in drysh)
#
# See e01cac2e on 200D 1.0.1 for most of the names, but note e01ca9ca
# calls user_mem "Heap".
#
# SJE TODO: add Ghidra structs to platform/200D ?  These have the field names.
#
# Canon also use names like user_mem_max, but sometimes this is len, not max.
# I use len or size when it's treated as a length.
#
# See e004010c for where these values are used to calc / position the regions.
# boot-d78.c adjusts these constants before the code runs.
#
# Presumably, if too much mem is stolen from user_mem, or sys region
# is moved too far upwards, Bad Things happen.
#
# We could calculate RESTARTSTART at runtime, but the build system currently
# needs a value for it, I believe because magiclantern binary is not PIC.
# Consequently, you need to work this out, and you need to ensure it's
# compatible with the limits defined in consts.h, see ML_MAX_* and
# ML_RESERVED_MEM.  This is a sensible default:
# *PTR_DRYOS_BASE + *PTR_SYS_OBJS_OFFSET - 0x40000
#
# It's a sensible precaution to pick a value that's well aligned,
# we run code from this address.
