ETTR is a techinque that optimizes your exposure for raw shooting, with the goal of minimizing noise without blowing the highlights. 

Auto ETTR will adjust the exposure for you until the histogram will 
touch the right side, but - whenever possible - without clipping. This will minimize image noise for your given set of restrictions
(e.g. slowest shutter, max ISO, or what highlights can be clipped).

You will usually have to darken the image in post (which is good).

Tip: on the raw histogram you will see an ETTR hint that can be used for manually exposing the image.
