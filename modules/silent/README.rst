Silent Pictures
===============

Take pictures in LiveView without shutter actuations.
Format: 14-bit DNG, low-resolution, depending on LiveView mode (1080p, 720p, zoom and so on).

You may want to load pic_view & file_man for reviewing pictures.

Modes:

* Simple: press the shutter halfway to take a picture.
* Burst: take pictures until memory gets full, then save to card.
* End Trigger: take pics continuously, save last few pics to card.
* Best Shots: take pics continuously, save the best (focused) pics.
* Slit-Scan: distorted pictures for funky effects.
