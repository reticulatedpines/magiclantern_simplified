/* Define LOG_EARLY_STARTUP to start logging before Canon's init_task.
 * Caveat: there's no malloc working at this stage.
 *
 * Previously, we have used statically allocated buffers, but these are very small.
 * The current codebase requires a large (32MB) hardcoded buffer for debug messages,
 * and two more hardcoded buffers for io_trace.
 *
 * Do NOT try to reuse the 80D addresses!
 * Rather, you will need to find out what addresses might be unused on your camera.
 * Refer to comments in log-d6.c (TLDR: enable CONFIG_MARK_UNUSED_MEMORY_AT_STARTUP).
