 * VRAM RGBA Compositor interface
 */
/*
 * kitor: So I found a compositor on EOSR
 * Uses up to 6 RGBA input layers, but Canon ever allocates only two.
 *
 * This uses RGBA layers that @coon noticed on RP long time ago.
 *
 * Layers are stored from bottom (0) to top (5). Canon uses 0 for GUI
 * and 1 for overlays in LV mode (focus overlay)
 *
 * I was able to create own layer(s), drawn above two Canon pre-allocated ones.
 * This PoC will allocate one new layer on top of existing two, and use that
 * buffer to draw on screen.
 *
 * Tested (briefly) on LV, menus, during recording, playback, also on HDMI.
 *
 * The only caveat that I was able to catch was me calling redraw while GUI
 * also wanted to redraw screen. This "glitched" by showing partially rendered
 * frame. Shouldn't be an issue while we have a control over GUI events.
 *
 * But since we don't have to constantly redraw until we want to update the
 * screen - there's no need to fight with Canon code.
 *
 * For drawing own LV overlays it should be enough to disable layers 0 (GUI)
 * and maybe 1 (AF points, AF confirmation).
 * LV calls redraw very often, so probably we don't need to call it ourselves
 * in that mode.
